2. Background & goals for the work ahead  
3. Group discussion  
4. Close—out & next steps

# **Notes**

* Amit walked us through the need for regulation and regulatory framework

  * Frameworks too siloed today

  * Reliance agreements

  * Mostly centralized systems today

  * Hard to share process and outcomes of those compliance KYC processes

  * Lots of duplication in the system

  * Sharing of the right data, and assurance that the right processes have been followed

  * Common frameworks and tooling to show regulators how the industry thinks about efficiencies and increased data privacy

* Gabe walked through the foundation of trust Frameworks

  * How we go from closed to open (which is the mission but we are not there yet)

  * How does the trust framework enable a network?

    * Governance is important

  * We do not work in isolation

  * Framework should be compatible with the rest of the ecosystem

  * GAN is an interesting potential collaboration opportunity — we could influence the financial services sub group in GAN — [https://gan.foundation/](https://gan.foundation/) 

  * TBD’s approach to credentialize a KYC process — flexible and extensible — [https://github.com/TBD54566975/known—customer—credential](https://github.com/TBD54566975/known-customer-credential) 

* Round Table across all participants 

  * Share a high level pitch of your business (Name, What your main product or service addresses, experience with Open Source Forums)

  * Desired outcomes:

    * What would you like to be able to do with tbDEX?

    * What does success in this effort look like for you? 

    * What do you plan to contribute?

  * **SmileID** — Mission is for every African to prove their identity to get access to financial services — started seven years ago

    * Customers want to interoperability with each other

    * Want to verify a credential that has been issued elsewhere

    * Customers that issue credentials

    * Cameron open to give his time and expertise specifically for Africa

  * Patrick Triest from **Chipper Cash**

    * Chipper provides payments globally

    * About five years

    * IDV is super inefficient for both the users and the payments companies

    * Chipper wants to see a more efficient onboarding and credentialing process

    * Payments system could be more efficient if value transfer is on a common protocol

    * Compliance should be very streamlined and decentralized (in different countries)

      * Ideally there is a consistent guideline

    * What they want to bring: 

      * They have seen a number of trust issues as they rolled out their technology

      * Bring insights from technical implementations

  * Austin — **Zero Hash** — Crypto as a service — onramp and offramp infrastructure (Dollars to stablecoin and crypto)

    * They are excited about the sharing abilities (same language, sharing proof of KYC) without the risk of data breaches

    * Mostly in the US (customer base)

    * Want to build standards that can meet compliance requirements

  * Amit — **Finclusive**

    * Privacy and consumer protection

    * Marketplace to enable financial institutions to find control and credential solutions

  * **CheqD** — Ankur

    * Decentralized ways 

    * Also part of GAN

    * Frauenhofer institute — on hybrid trust framework

      * How do various credentials interop with one another
